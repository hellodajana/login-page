### Assignment

The login form should have the following fields:

- Email address
- Password
- Sumbit button
- If the login is successful, the access token should be stored in a cookie or local storage.
- If the login fails, error message should be displayed.
- Logout button that removes the access token from the cookie or local storage

### Continued development

- Display appropriate message when the client sends an invalid request to the server
- Write test that checks if form stores the access token in a cookie or local storage if the login is successful
- Write test for logout button
